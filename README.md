# Windows Azure VM for Cloud Platforms Streaming

This repo contains various assets used to provision a Windows-based VM in
Azure to run OBS for live streaming.

## Build VM
Go to https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template, select "Build your own template in the editor" and load the
the `template_parameters.json` and `build_vm_template.json` (in that order) to initially
build the base VM.

When the provisioning process is complete, RDP connect to the VM and be sure
to set the sound settings in your RDP client (eg: Remmina) to `remote`.

Once connected, open a file explorer and navigate to `C:\` and install the
virtual audio cable driver with the executable file `vacxxx.exe`.

At this point you can either run `C:\firstrun.bat` and start using this VM,
or you could sysprep it to create an image of it and use it later. Using a
sysprep'd image will be marginally faster to provision.

## Imaging the VM
If you want to image the VM, run `C:\prepme.bat` which will run sysprep and
then shut down the machine. After the machine shuts down, follow [these
instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/capture-image-resource#create-a-managed-image-in-the-portal)
for creating a managed image.

## Deploy from an Image
If you imaged your VM, you can deploy from that image by using the template
deploy link above and use `imaged_vm_template.json` instead. However, you
**will** need to modify the file to point to the correct resource URL for the
image in your Azure account.
